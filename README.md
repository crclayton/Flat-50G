## A modern HP-50G skin

The existing HP-50G emulator skins are starting to look dated, so I made a new one. I designed a modern flat interface, improved the keyboard shortcuts, increased the screen size, changed the screen's usual ugly green colour, and now it's my favourite mathematical tool. 

### How to Use

Start the Emu48.exe emulator. When prompted for a KML script, go to the folder containing the `Flat 50G (Wide).kml` file then select  `Flat HP-50G (Wide)`. After the emulator opens, you may choose to load my prefered settings by going to `File > Open > settings.E49`.
