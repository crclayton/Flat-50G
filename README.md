### A modern HP-50G skin

The existing HP-50G emulator skins are starting to look dated, so I made a new one. I designed a modern flat interface, improved the keyboard shortcuts, increased the screen size, changed the screen's usual ugly green colour, and now it's my favourite mathematical tool. It can be run on Windows PCs are Linux systems with `Wine`.

To use, start the Emu48.exe emulator. When prompted for a KML script, go to the folder containing the `Flat 50G (Wide).kml` file then select  `Flat HP-50G (Wide)`. After the emulator opens, you may choose to load my prefered settings by going to `File > Open > settings.E49`.
