### A modern HP-50G skin

The existing HP-50G emulator skins are starting to look very dated. So I designed a modern flat interface, improved the keybindings, increased the screen size, changed its the screen's ugly green colour, and now it's my favourite mathematical tool.

To use, start the Emu48.exe emulator. When prompted for a KML script, go to the folder containing the `Flat 50G.kml` file then select  `Flat HP-50G by Charles Clayton`. After the emulator opens load the settings file by going to `File > Open > settings.E49`.
